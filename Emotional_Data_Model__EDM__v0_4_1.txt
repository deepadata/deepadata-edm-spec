Abstract
Artificial intelligence systems currently lack a stable, interoperable substrate for representing affective context. While contemporary large language models internalise emotional, narrative, and motivational cues transiently within latent activations, these signals remain non-portable, non-inspectable, and vulnerable to drift across model updates, vendors, and computational environments. The Emotional Data Model (EDM) addresses this gap by defining a governed, schema-bound representational format that externalises affective context as a deterministic, model-agnostic data object. EDM v0.4.0 specifies domain-complete structures for narrative anchors, affective topology, salience geometry, contextual framing, and in-band governance, ensuring long-range interpretability without reliance on inference or behavioural semantics.
To ensure persistence, transportability, and sovereignty, EDM artifacts are encapsulated within the .ddna envelope, a byte-stable container providing canonical serialisation, integrity guarantees, and immutable governance attachment. The combined architecture establishes a clear separation between Representation, Persistence, and Computation, enabling downstream systems to compute over stable artifacts without redefining their structure. This whitepaper formalises the representational architecture, versioning discipline, and persistence model required for durable affective context in AI ecosystems, establishing a foundation for sovereign emotional memory capable of supporting cross-vendor interoperability and coherence-aligned computation across future model generations. ________________________________________
Core Contribution
This work formalises the distinction between semantic content and affective state, proposing a composite representational geometry defined as:
R(x) = (Σ(x), E(x))
where Σ(x) denotes the semantic substrate and E(x) denotes the structured affective mapping encoded via the EDM schema. Unlike current approaches, where E(x) is implicit and transient, this protocol instantiates E(x) as an explicit, governed, and persistent data object.
By externalising these elements, the protocol achieves three architectural invariants:
	Representational Stability: Emotional signals remain interpretable across model families and computational eras, decoupled from the specific inference engine used to generate them.
	Sovereign Persistence: The .ddna envelope binds governance logic—including jurisdiction, identity rights, and retention policies—directly to the data payload, ensuring compliance persists during transport.
	Non-Inferential Structure: The architecture enforces a strict boundary where representation precedes computation, supporting the emergence of coherence-aligned AI systems built on stable data rather than implicit behaviour. ________________________________________
0. Executive Architecture Summary
The Emotional Data Model (EDM) v0.4.0 defines a governed, schema-bound representational architecture for encoding affective context as a stable, machine-interpretable data object. The architecture specifies the complete set of structural domains, serialisation rules, versioning guarantees, and in-band governance requirements necessary to ensure representational fidelity across heterogeneous systems.
The schema mandates a domain-complete manifold comprising ten top-level domains: meta, core, constellation, milky_way, gravity, impulse, governance, telemetry, system, and crosswalks. Each domain contributes a discrete representational function essential to schema completeness, and no domain may be removed, omitted, collapsed, or derived.
Representation is preserved by the .ddna envelope, which functions as the architecture's persistence and sovereignty layer. The .ddna structure encapsulates the unmodified EDM payload, enforces byte-stable serialisation, binds governance and jurisdictional metadata, and provides integrity and provenance guarantees through deterministic hashing and optional signing. The envelope is strictly prohibited from introducing behavioural semantics, altering representational content, reinterpreting schema fields, or embedding model-dependent structures.
To reconcile immediate utility with long-term sovereignty, the architecture supports two operational modalities: a stateless configuration for immediate session-level coherence, where the artifact remains ephemeral and unsealed; and a persistent configuration, where the artifact is sealed within the .ddna envelope to ensure sovereignty, rights preservation, and transportability.
Together, EDM and .ddna form the Emotional Data Architecture Stack: a representational layer and a persistence layer that operate independently yet jointly enforce structural invariants, governance fidelity, and long-term interpretability. This architecture provides the conditions under which affective context can exist as a versioned, governed, interoperable, and platform-neutral data object.

1. Architectural Foundations of EDM v0.4.0
1.1 The Representational Deficit
Contemporary intelligent systems lack an external, governed, and durable representational layer for affective context. While model-internal activations may correlate with affective features, these signals are transient, architecture-bound, and non-deterministic. The implicit signal definitions of these states drift with training cycles, architectural revisions, sampling behaviour, and vendor-specific implementations, preventing the formation of consistent, cross-model referents for emotional structure. This absence renders affective context non-transferable and computationally brittle, as downstream systems must rely on unstable latent geometries rather than fixed representational coordinates.
1.2 The Sovereignty Gap
Beyond technical instability, the lack of an explicit schema creates a fundamental safety and compliance vulnerability. Because internal emotional states are not discrete data objects, they cannot encode retention policies, jurisdictional constraints, or subject rights. An inferred emotional state exists only as a probability within a neural network, making it inherently ungovernable. It cannot be audited for bias, deleted upon request, or restricted by consent. EDM addresses this deficiency by externalising affective context into a structured, domain-complete object. By transforming implicit behaviour into explicit data, the architecture enables the attachment of in-band governance, ensuring that emotional signals are not only interpretable but legally and ethically compliant across their lifecycle.
1.3 Architectural Principles
The EDM architecture is governed by three non-negotiable normative principles designed to ensure long-range stability and safety:
	Explicit Representational Structure: All affective contexts MUST be encoded as explicit fields within a domain-complete schema. No diagnosed, reconstructed, or predictive content is permitted to enter the representational payload; population MUST be derived from explicit extraction or direct declaration, ensuring the artifact records extracted structure rather than clinical diagnosis or behavioural prediction.
	In-Band Governance: Governance descriptors—including consent basis, jurisdiction, retention, visibility, exportability, policy constraints, and rights declarations—MUST be encoded in-band within the representational layer. Governance is structurally inseparable from the artifact and cannot be detached, overridden, or externally appended.
	Strict Layer Separation: Representation, persistence, and computation act as distinct architectural layers. EDM v0.4.0 defines representational structure only; the .ddna envelope defines persistence and sovereignty only; external systems define computational behaviour only. No layer may redefine the representational semantics or geometry of another. Structural meaning MUST NOT depend on model architecture, embedding space, inference strategy, or downstream computational operator.
1.4 Scope
This specification defines the Emotional Data Architecture Stack. Its normative scope includes:
	EDM v0.4.0: The governed, domain-complete representational schema for affective context.
	The .ddna Envelope: The sovereign, byte-stable persistence and integrity layer.
	The Compute Boundary: The interface definitions required to expose artifacts to the External Compute Layer.
The following are explicitly out of scope for this specification: the internal logic of inference processes, appraisal mechanisms, behavioural modelling, psychological interpretation, optimisation strategies, and the algorithms of downstream coherence engines. These belong exclusively to the External Compute Layer and do not form part of the representational or persistence definitions. ________________________________________

2. Background & Prior Work
The Emotional Data Architecture Stack addresses the absence of an explicit, governed, and structurally stable representation of affective context in contemporary AI systems. Existing architectures provide mechanisms for linguistic transformation, pattern modelling, and multimodal inference, but they do not provide a data-level substrate capable of encoding affective structure as a durable, interpretable, and transportable object. This section situates EDM v0.4.0 and the .ddna envelope within the technical lineage that motivates the need for an externalised representational layer.
2.1 Affective Context as the Organising Substrate
In biological intelligence, affective context functions as the organising substrate of memory and attention. Research in affective neuroscience (Damasio, Panksepp) demonstrates that emotion is not a post-hoc reaction to processing, but a pre-computational substrate that constrains search spaces, assigns salience, and ensures coherence. In these systems, the "Somatic Marker"—a stable, felt state—precedes and guides high-level reasoning. This reference is included solely for historical lineage; EDM does not implement somatic-marker theory nor any biological or behavioural mechanisms, and the concept is not imported into the representational schema.
Contemporary AI architectures invert this priority. They attempt to derive affective context as a transient byproduct of semantic processing, rather than establishing it as a foundational input. By treating emotion as a latent output rather than a structural input, current systems suffer from a representational inversion: they attempt to compute significance without a stable reference for what is significant. EDM v0.4.0 resolves this inversion by re-establishing the biological order: it defines a stable, governed representational layer for affect that exists before and independent of the reasoning and inference process.
2.2 Limitations of Model-Internal Signals
Model-internal affective signals fail as representational structures because they are artefacts of inference rather than explicitly defined data. Their formation depends on vendor-specific training regimes, latent geometries, and architectural parameters that lack cross-model continuity. These internal signals exhibit architectural instability, as internal feature representations are specific to a model family and cannot be decoded or interpreted by unrelated architectures. They demonstrate temporal instability, where model updates, fine-tunes, and retraining cycles alter internal geometries, preventing long-range continuity. Contextual variability arises where input phrasing, sampling behaviour, and runtime conditions alter internal activations in non-deterministic ways. Finally, they suffer from governance absence, as internal activations cannot encode rights, jurisdiction, retention policy, or consent metadata. Because model-internal structures cannot be stabilised, governed, or externalised, they do not constitute a viable substrate for representational architecture.
2.3 Structural Requirements for Durable Representation
To establish a durable, affective representation layer, the architecture must satisfy specific structural requirements. The representation must be Explicit, encoding affective structures as concrete schema fields rather than latent vectors. It must enforce Domain Completeness, ensuring all ten top-level domains are present to maintain representational coherence. Representational Semantics must be Non-Inferential, containing only extracted or directly provided content without latent reconstruction. Furthermore, the architecture requires In-Band Governance, where rights and obligations are encoded in the object itself, and Persistence, ensuring artifacts remain byte-stable and portable across vendors and time. Finally, the schema must maintain Model Neutrality, independent of any embedding family or internal geometry.
2.4 Technical Lineage
EDM v0.4.0 draws architectural precedent from established representational systems without inheriting their specific semantics. It builds upon the tradition of structured augmentation systems established by Bush, Engelbart, and Berners-Lee, which demonstrated the necessity of addressable, governed data layers. It also aligns with schema-first interoperability frameworks such as JSON-LD and HL7 FHIR, which establish that governed, domain-complete schemas are essential for long-range interoperability across heterogeneous vendors. Crucially, the protocol's sovereignty model draws architectural inspiration from W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), adopting the principle of cryptographically separating the subject (User) from the issuer (System) to ensure portable, user-centric control over sensitive claims.
2.5 Structural Gaps in Existing Memory Systems
Despite these precedents, existing memory systems in AI—including vector stores, RAG pipelines, and proprietary caches—lack essential representational capabilities for affect. They fail to provide explicit affective representation, rights-bearing metadata, persistent salience descriptors, or transportable interpretability. EDM addresses these gaps by defining a governed, schema-complete, model-neutral representational substrate that can persist independently of any computational system. ________________________________________
3. Architectural Overview
The EDM architecture establishes the representational substrate required for the stable, governed encoding of affective context within intelligent systems. The architecture functions exclusively as a representational specification; it does not embed computational logic, behavioural operators, or inferential processes. Instead, it specifies the representational and persistence layers that form the foundation upon which independent computational systems may operate. This separation ensures that affective context remains a consistent, model-neutral object of interpretation, insulated from changes in inference techniques, platform implementations, and vendor ecosystems.
All computation—including appraisal, retrieval, weighting, generation, coherence operations, or alignment—remains strictly outside the representational layer. EDM defines the structural form of affective context; the .ddna envelope defines its preservation mechanism; and external systems determine its usage. This division is fundamental to the architecture's long-term stability.
3.1 High-Level Design Goals & Constraints
The architecture is guided by normative design constraints that define its structural boundaries and ensure long-term viability.
	Representational Stability: Semantics must remain fixed regardless of changes in model architecture, embedding methods, versioning, or platform transitions.
	Interpretive Consistency: The structural definition of every field is defined exclusively by the schema, ensuring a stable representational contract across heterogeneous systems without enforcing identical subjective interpretation.
	Governance Integration: Rights, consent, retention, jurisdiction, visibility, and exportability constraints are encoded in-band and may not be detached, overridden, or altered by downstream actors.
	Architecture Neutrality: The schema must not depend on embeddings, inference systems, latent geometries, or model-internal patterns.
	Persistence Durability: Artifacts must retain byte-stable identity across storage, transport, and system migration.
	Non-Inferential Representation: Only explicit, extracted, or declared information may appear in representational fields; no psychological reconstruction or latent inference is permitted.
	Interoperability: Achieved through crosswalk mappings that reference both established taxonomies and emerging sensing modalities—including prosody, facial landmarks, and empathetic inference signals—without altering domain semantics.
3.2 The EDM Manifold
The EDM schema defines a representational manifold composed of five interdependent central domains—Core, Constellation, Milky_Way, Gravity, and Impulse—supported by five peripheral governance and metadata structures: Meta, Governance, Telemetry, System, and Crosswalks. Each domain contributes a distinct structural dimension of affective context. The presence of all domains is REQUIRED to maintain representational coherence.
The Core domain establishes narrative anchoring through structural primitives that define the internal organisation of the context, while Constellation encodes affective topology using explicit, non-inferential fields. The Milky_Way domain captures contextual placement and environmental markers, whereas Gravity defines salience parameters and recurrence structure. Impulse records motivational and directional configuration as explicit state vectors without behavioural inference. These domains function as a complete set; they MUST NOT be collapsed, merged, or optionally omitted. Their independence ensures that each representational dimension remains structurally stable, while their interdependence guarantees that the artifact contains sufficient fidelity to be interpreted consistently in future computational environments.
3.3 Separation of Representation vs. Computation
Representation is defined solely by the EDM schema; persistence is defined solely by the .ddna envelope; and computation is strictly external to this architecture. This boundary prevents representational drift by ensuring that no computational operator—whether retrieval, ranking, appraisal, synthesis, or weighting—can modify representational structure or embed model-specific assumptions.
The architecture STRICTLY PROHIBITS:
	The embedding of computed features or latent-space descriptors within representational fields.
	The storage of model-internal activations.
	The definition of fields whose representational semantics depend on a specific model.
This separation is a normative constraint; any system reading an EDM artifact MUST apply governance and validation before computation and MUST NOT alter representational content. The architecture thereby ensures multi-vendor interoperability and long-range interpretive stability.

3.4 Identity, Sovereignty & Longevity Principles
EDM defines affective artifacts as sovereign, rights-bearing objects. Sovereignty is enforced through in-band governance metadata—including jurisdiction, retention, and rights descriptors—that remains structurally attached to the artifact throughout its lifecycle. Identity association, where required, is mediated exclusively through AuraID, a neutral binding mechanism that preserves the strict separation of representation from identity.
This separation is the architectural enabler for the Stateless Configuration: because identity is defined as a detachable binding rather than an intrinsic representational property, systems may generate, process, and discard fully populated affective artifacts without creating persistent identity associations. Sovereignty is architecturally enforced by embedding governance rules directly within the artifact and strictly prohibiting downstream systems from detaching, overriding, or reinterpreting this metadata. Version identifiers serve as immutable anchors for long-range interpretability, ensuring that artifacts remain intelligible across decades regardless of changes in model architecture or computational paradigms.

3.5 Architecture Topology
The architecture is defined by three primary visual schemas that illustrate the structural relationships between components:

3.6 Operational Modalities
To support flexible integration while enforcing sovereignty, the architecture defines two operational modalities.
Stateless Configuration (Coherence Mode) A system generates a domain-complete EDM artifact populated according to the schema. In this state, the artifact acts as a transient representational object, enabling immediate affective coherence and context shaping within a session or chat environment. Compliant systems MUST treat these unsealed artifacts as volatile. If the artifact is not committed to a persistent state, sensitive domains—specifically Milky_Way (Context) and Gravity (Salience)—MUST be definitively nulled or discarded upon session completion. Narrative and affective state domains (Core, Constellation, Impulse) MAY be retained to enable high-fidelity coherence and provide a structured, anonymised signal for system optimisation.
Persistent Configuration (Sovereign Mode) Upon a commitment event (e.g., user confirmation or system archive command), the artifact is sealed inside a .ddna envelope. This binds identity, salience, affective context, and governance metadata to the payload, transforming the transient signal into a sovereign, immutable memory object. ________________________________________
4. EDM v0.4.0 Schema Architecture
The EDM v0.4.0 schema defines the representational substrate through which affective context is encoded as a structured, governed, model-agnostic data object.  EDM treats affective context as a structured manifold where each domain contributes a distinct coordinate dimension essential for representational completeness. The schema enforces domain completeness, byte-stable structure, explicit nullability, and a strict separation between representational semantics and computational processes.
For the complete normative definition of fields, data types, enumerations, and validation constraints, refer to Appendix A: Canonical EDM Schema.
4.1 Formal Representational Geometry
To formalise the distinction between latent inference and explicit structure, EDM defines affective representation as a composite state:
R(x)=(Σ(x),E(x))
In this formulation, Σ(x)  denotes the semantic substrate—encompassing the lexical, multimodal, or embedding-based content of the input—while E(x)  denotes the structured affective mapping encoded via the EDM schema. Unlike contemporary architectures where affective state is treated as a transient derivative of Σ(x) , this protocol instantiates E(x) as an explicit, independent data object. The representational manifold defined by E(x)comprises ten mandatory domains, establishing a fixed coordinate system for narrative, emotional, and motivational state.
This geometry imposes a strict computational boundary. Downstream systems operate only on the fully realised represented state, denoted as:
I(x)=C(R(x)),
where C represents the external computational operator. This ordering enforces the architectural invariant that representation must precede computation. No computational system is permitted to modify, reinterpret, or derive new representational semantics for any domain within E(x) after artifact creation. By mathematically decoupling the affective structure E(x) from the inference engine (C), the architecture ensures that emotional context remains a stable, governable invariant across heterogeneous model generations.
4.2 Representation Invariants
The EDM schema defines non-negotiable representational invariants that ensure each artifact remains structurally complete and geometrically stable. Domain Completeness requires that all ten top-level domains be present in every artifact, with absence expressed only through explicit null values. The No Omission, No Inference rule mandates that extractors populate fields only with observable or directly expressed attributes; no field may contain content derived from psychological diagnosis, behavioural prediction, or latent reconstruction. Canonical Enumerations must be used for all categorical fields, and Byte-Stable Payload Rules prohibit reordering, normalization, or structural modification during handling. Finally, Interpretive Stability ensures that the artifact remains semantically interpretable across model generations by avoiding model-specific latent geometry.
4.3 The Affective Manifold (Domains)
The primary function of EDM is to stabilise emotional meaning into five distinct representational planes. These domains constitute the central representational manifold, encoding the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of experience without reliance on transient inference.
Narrative Primitives (Core)
The Core domain establishes the structural foundation of the experience, anchoring the context through positional primitives. It identifies the anchor as the central referent and the spark as the initiating trigger, distinguishing the event from its emotional consequence. The domain maps the wound—the point of disruption or vulnerability—and the fuel that sustains the emotional energy, enabling systems to structure the causal geometry of an experience. By encoding the bridge as the transitional structure and the echo as the residual continuity, the schema provides deterministic coordinates for identifying narrative progression.
Emotional Topology (Constellation)
The Constellation domain maps the qualitative landscape of the affect. It captures the emotion_primary and emotion_subtone using canonical vocabularies, providing a stable categorical reference that persists across model versions. It records the subject's structural role via the narrative_archetype, defining their position within the story geometry. The domain distinguishes between routine processing and fundamental shifts in state through the transformational_pivot marker, and captures explicit realisations via expressed_insight. To link text with somatic state, it records the somatic_signature, ensuring that the quality and certainty of the signal are represented as explicitly as its content.
Contextual Framing (Milky_Way)
The Milky_Way domain situates the emotion within specific environmental and relational coordinates. It defines the location_context, associated_people, and event_type, providing the environmental data necessary to differentiate context without containing the emotional signal itself. This separation ensures that context remains distinct from affect, allowing systems to compute situational relevance independently of emotional intensity.
Salience & Dynamics (Gravity)
The Gravity domain quantifies the salience dynamics of the memory. It encodes emotional_weight as a scalar value, defining the artifact's resistance to decay and its priority within retrieval operations. It tracks the recurrence_pattern to distinguish between isolated events and chronic themes, and defines the tether_type to identify the mechanism binding the emotion to the subject. This domain provides the quantitative inputs required for resonance-weighted retrieval, enabling systems to prioritise memory recall based on their structural significance rather than recency or lexicon alone.
Motivational Orientation (Impulse)
The Impulse domain encodes the directional vector of the experience. It describes the drive_state and urgency of the representation, structuring motivational energy as a vector rather than a static label. By explicitly defining the directionality, the protocol allows downstream agents to align their responses with the user's directional intent, ensuring that the system supports the user's movement toward or away from a stimulus without inferring moral judgment.
4.4 Governance & Sovereignty Architecture
EDM differentiates itself from standard metadata schemas by treating governance as a structural invariant equal in importance to the content itself. The Governance domain establishes the regulatory framework governing artifact handling. Unlike Meta (which records artifact identity and provenance), Governance defines the legal obligations, retention requirements, subject rights, and compliance conditions that systems MUST enforce. This separation ensures that regulatory constraints remain distinct from extraction metadata while maintaining in-band sovereignty guarantees. It defines the jurisdiction governing the data, the retention_policy determining its lifespan, and the subject_rights (such as portability and erasure) that travel with the object. This in-band governance model ensures that compliance and user rights are preserved even as the artifact moves across vendor boundaries.
4.5 Infrastructure & Interoperability
The remaining domains provide the technical scaffolding required for integration, provenance, and cross-system translation. The System domain manages vector compatibility through stable vector_refs, ensuring the artifact remains independent of any specific embedding model. The Telemetry domain records static extraction metadata, including entry_confidence and the source model identifier, ensuring auditability of the extraction process without embedding dynamic usage statistics. The Meta domain anchors the artifact in time and provenance, while the Crosswalks domain ensures long-range interoperability by providing non-destructive mappings to external taxonomies—allowing the protocol to evolve alongside affective science without destabilising its core representation.

5. Structural Invariants & Normative Guarantees
The EDM v0.4.0 schema is governed by a set of structural invariants that define the representational boundaries of the architecture. These invariants regulate how artifacts are formed, preserved, and interpreted across systems and temporal horizons. They apply exclusively to the EDM representational layer and precede any persistence guarantees introduced by the .ddna envelope. Their purpose is to maintain the stability of the affective manifold defined in Section 4, ensuring that representational semantics remain uniform across implementations and model generations. These invariants constitute the non-negotiable architectural rules of the Emotional Data Architecture Stack; they specify constraints on structure, semantics, and population that MUST be satisfied for an artifact to be considered valid.
5.1 Domain Completeness
Domain completeness requires that all ten top-level domains of the EDM manifold be physically present in every artifact. Because each domain expresses a distinct dimension of affective representation, the omission of any domain weakens the structural integrity of the manifold and interrupts interpretive continuity. While internal population may vary—and fields may contain null values when information is absent—the structural presence of all domains is MANDATORY. This invariant ensures that downstream systems receive a deterministic representational frame, independent of extraction method or content density. Domain completeness is the prerequisite for schema stability, long-term preservation, and cross-model interoperability.
5.2 Population Invariants: No Omission, No Inference
The population of the schema is governed by two complementary rules. First, the No Omission rule mandates that fields lacking content MUST be populated with explicit null values; silent omission is prohibited. Every representational absence must be encoded as a structural fact. Second, the No Inference rule dictates that extractors may populate fields only with observable or directly expressed attributes. No field may contain content derived from psychological diagnosis, behavioural prediction, or latent reconstruction. Population MUST be derived from explicit computational extraction or direct declaration, ensuring the artifact records observed structure rather than inferred mental states. Together, these rules ensure that EDM artifacts reflect the representational substrate of the source material without introducing interpretive drift or latent behavioural semantics.
5.3 Canonical Enumerations
Enumerated fields—including affect classes, subtones, relational stance identifiers, structural markers, consent bases, and jurisdiction tags—MUST use the canonical enumerations defined by the v0.4.0 schema. Enumerations MUST NOT be extended, reinterpreted, or replaced by vendor-specific alternatives. Any modification to these sets requires an explicit schema version change under the evolution principles defined in Section 11. Canonical enumerations ensure that implementations across heterogeneous platforms reference the same representational semantics, maintaining alignment with the formal affective manifold and preventing semantic fragmentation.
5.4 Byte-Stable Payload Rules
Byte stability requires that the serialized form of an EDM artifact remain identical across storage systems, transport mechanisms, and platform boundaries. Artifacts MUST NOT be rewritten, normalized, or structurally modified during handling. This invariant STRICTLY PROHIBITS the reordering of fields, automated renaming, whitespace or formatting normalization, the embedding of vector data in representation fields, and any transport-layer conversions that alter structure. Byte-stable encoding ensures that integrity checks, governance enforcement, schema validation, and long-term archival practices can rely on deterministic structural identity.
5.5 Interpretive Stability Across Model Generations
Interpretive stability requires that an EDM artifact remain semantically interpretable across successive generations of models, regardless of changes in architecture, inference mechanisms, or embedding spaces. This invariant is enabled by the schema's architecture-neutral design: representational semantics are defined externally to model behaviour. To achieve this stability, the architecture mandates consistent domain meanings, explicit field definitions, the avoidance of model-specific latent geometry, and strict independence from inference pathways. Interpretive stability positions the EDM manifold as a long-term representational substrate capable of surviving computational and architectural change without semantic loss.
5.6 Temporal Coherence & Provenance Anchoring
Temporal coherence requires that temporal metadata—including timestamps, extraction context, and lifecycle markers—remain intact and unaltered across all systems that store or process an artifact. Provenance anchoring ensures that the temporal signature of an artifact remains attached to the representational payload without reinterpretation. This invariant supports auditability, chronological reconstruction, multi-model lineage tracing, and deterministic reasoning about extraction context. Temporal coherence ensures that time-dependent relationships across artifacts are maintained without requiring model-internal reconstruction or historical inference.
5.7 Schema Evolution Principles
Schema evolution follows controlled, versioned change. All modifications MUST adhere to strict architectural principles: backward-compatible additions require a minor version increment, while structural changes or modifications to representational semantics require a major version increment. Deprecations MUST be explicit and accompanied by defined downgrade procedures. Forward compatibility requires that future implementations interpret legacy artifacts without representational loss. Cross-version interpretability MUST be preserved through stable field meanings and deterministic migration pathways, preventing fragmentation of the representational ecosystem and maintaining coherence as the schema evolves.
________________________________________
6. Identity, Sovereignty & Governance Architecture
Identity, sovereignty, and governance constitute structural properties encoded directly within the EDM schema and preserved by the .ddna envelope. These properties define the representational conditions under which an EDM artifact remains intact, rights-bearing, and interpretable across storage, execution, or vendor environments. They do not describe operational behaviour or enforcement mechanisms; rather, they establish the immutable constraints that downstream systems MUST honour. Any modification to governance descriptors or identity-binding metadata constitutes a formal representational update and MUST follow schema-governed processes.
6.1 Sovereign Artifact Model
The EDM artifact operates as a sovereign representational object. Its content, governance descriptors, and envelope-level integrity markers form a single, byte-stable structure. Governance fields—including consent basis, jurisdiction, retention semantics, visibility rules, exportability constraints, and subject-rights descriptors—reside within the Governance domain and remain structurally attached to the artifact for its entire lifecycle. Sovereignty is an architectural condition; governance MUST NOT be detached, overridden, externalised, or reinterpreted without altering the representational object itself. The .ddna envelope enforces this condition by preserving governance metadata exactly as encoded and ensuring that all header–payload coupling remains byte-stable. Consequently, sovereignty persists across system boundaries as a structural invariant of the representational object.
6.2 AuraID Identity Binding
AuraID provides an optional identity-binding mechanism that maintains strict separation between subject metadata and affective representation. Identity-binding metadata resides exclusively within designated metadata fields and MUST NOT appear within narrative, affective, contextual, or structural domains. The presence of identity associations does not modify the meaning of representational fields. This separation is the architectural enabler for the Stateless Configuration: because identity is defined as a detachable binding rather than an intrinsic representational property, systems may generate, process, and discard fully populated affective artifacts without creating persistent identity associations. Identity bindings may be rotated, revoked, or replaced through schema-compliant updates without altering the EDM payload. When encapsulated within a .ddna envelope, identity-binding metadata is preserved under the same versioning, integrity, and sovereignty guarantees that apply to governance descriptors. Identity binding remains a portable metadata association rather than a component of affective representation.
6.3 Retention, Consent & Jurisdiction Descriptors
Retention windows, consent bases, jurisdiction codes, and visibility classes are fixed, declarative fields within the Governance domain. Their governance semantics are defined exclusively by the schema and remain independent of organisational policy or implementation detail. These descriptors specify the representational conditions under which an artifact must be stored, processed, or transferred. Because these fields form part of the representational object, they remain authoritative throughout the artifact's lifetime. Changes to these descriptors constitute representational updates governed by schema version discipline. Schema-extrinsic reinterpretation, custom enumerations, or context-dependent semantics are STRICTLY PROHIBITED to preserve interoperability and long-range consistency.
6.4 Exportability Controls
Exportability is encoded as a representational constraint that specifies the permissible scope of artifact relocation. These descriptors DEFINE whether transfer is structurally allowed, which destination classes or jurisdictions are authorized, and how governance conditions persist across boundaries. The .ddna envelope MUST preserve exportability descriptors exactly as encoded. These descriptors do not implement enforcement mechanisms themselves; rather, they define the representational constraints that downstream systems MUST evaluate prior to any transfer operation. Exportability functions solely as a structural boundary condition within the artifact.
6.5 Rights Descriptors & Subject-Aligned Controls
Subject-rights descriptors—including erasure, revocation, visibility modification, and access rights—are declarative structures within the Governance domain. They do not describe enforcement workflows or behavioural procedures; they ESTABLISH the representational obligations that MUST be honoured prior to processing the artifact. These descriptors apply uniformly to the representational payload and all associated identity-binding metadata. They MUST NOT introduce narrative, affective, or contextual semantics. Their sole function is to ensure subject alignment through structural embedding.
6.6 Multi-Party Context Structures
EDM supports multiple subject associations within a single representational object. Multi-party structures consist of independent identity-binding metadata and corresponding governance descriptors. These structures indicate only the existence of multiple subject associations and MUST NOT be used to encode relational, interpersonal, or behavioural meaning. Differential jurisdiction, visibility, or rights descriptors across subjects MUST NOT alter representational semantics. The blending, aggregation, or inference of shared attributes is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. Multi-party context remains a structural configuration of independently governed associations.
6.7 Reduced-Governance Configuration (Stateless Mode)
The schema defines a reduced-governance configuration for contexts where identity association, extended retention, or subject-level governance is unnecessary. In this Stateless Mode, while the artifact maintains domain completeness to support immediate coherence, sensitive domains—specifically Milky_Way (Context) and Gravity (Salience)—MUST be nulled if the artifact is transitioned to any form of storage outside the active session. Narrative and affective state domains (Core, Constellation, Impulse) MAY be retained to enable high-fidelity coherence and provide a structured, anonymised signal for system optimisation. This configuration ensures that representational geometry remains identical while eliminating persistent identity footprints, allowing artifacts to function as safe, interoperable training signals for generalised affective alignment. Statelessness is a variation in governance and content scope, not a different representational mode, and remains interoperable with full-governance artifacts through shared schema boundaries.
________________________________________
7. The .ddna Envelope Architecture
The .ddna envelope provides the persistence and sovereignty layer for the Emotional Data Architecture Stack. While EDM defines the representational manifold, the envelope defines the structural, cryptographic, and governance guarantees required to preserve that representation across storage regimes, computational systems, and temporal horizons. The envelope functions strictly as a container, not a transformation layer; it MUST NOT compress, optimise, reinterpret, or reorder representational content. Its sole architectural function is to ensure that an EDM artifact remains intact, verifiable, and governed as a byte-stable object. The envelope constitutes a deterministic, versioned structure whose semantics are fixed by this specification, guaranteeing that representational content, governance descriptors, and integrity material remain co-located and authoritative across heterogeneous environments.
7.1 Purpose of .ddna
The .ddna envelope establishes four normative architectural guarantees. Persistence ensures that representational content remains stable across storage systems, migrations, and long-horizon archival. Sovereignty mandates that governance descriptors remain structurally inseparable from the payload and cannot be externalised or superseded by platform-level policy. Integrity ensures the detectability of any mutation through deterministic cryptographic verification. Portability guarantees that the artifact remains interpretable across model families, embedding standards, and vendor ecosystems. These guarantees position the envelope as the authoritative vessel for long-lived affective representation, distinguishing it from transient wire formats.

7.1.1 File Extension and MIME Type Conventions
The .ddna envelope uses a standardised file extension and MIME type to ensure consistent handling across systems:

| Artifact Type | Extension | MIME Type | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Unsealed EDM artifact | `.edm.json` | `application/json` | Raw EDM artifact for interchange |
| Sealed .ddna envelope | `.ddna` | `application/vnd.deepadata.ddna+json` | Governed, signed envelope |

The `.ddna` extension (without `.json` suffix) signals that the file is a governed artifact requiring tooling for proper handling, similar to how `.pdf` signals a document requiring a PDF reader. This convention:
- Distinguishes sealed envelopes from unsealed artifacts
- Enables operating systems and tooling to associate appropriate handlers
- Signals governance requirements to downstream systems

Internal storage systems MAY use different conventions, but interchange formats MUST use these canonical extensions.

7.2 Envelope Structure
The envelope comprises three mandatory components: a Header (`ddna_header`), an EDM Payload (`edm_payload`), and a Proof Block (`proof`).
The Header defines the metadata required for deterministic decoding. It records the envelope version, EDM schema version, identity-binding configuration, governance mode (full or stateless), and lifecycle audit chain. These descriptors constitute the interpretive rules governing the envelope and MUST remain byte-stable to ensure long-range legibility.
The Payload stores the unmodified EDM artifact. The envelope MUST NOT reformat domain structure, suppress null values, reorder keys, embed vectors, or introduce interpretive transformations. Payload content is preserved byte-for-byte to ensure that the signed content matches the representational state exactly.
The Proof Block contains the W3C Data Integrity proof that cryptographically binds the header and payload. The proof enables verification that the envelope content has not been modified since signing.
7.3 Cryptographic Guarantees
Envelope integrity is enforced through W3C Data Integrity Proofs using the `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite. This standard-compliant approach provides cryptographic binding without requiring separate hash fields.
The signing process follows these steps:
1. Canonicalization: Both `ddna_header` and `edm_payload` are canonicalized using JSON Canonicalization Scheme (RFC 8785 JCS).
2. Hash Computation: The signing input is computed as: `SHA-256(JCS(proof_options)) || SHA-256(JCS(document))` where `document` contains the header and payload.
3. Signature Generation: An Ed25519 signature (RFC 8032) is computed over the 64-byte signing input.
4. Encoding: The signature is encoded using multibase base58-btc (prefix `z`).
Verification is performed by resolving the DID URL in the `verificationMethod` field, reconstructing the signing input from the canonical forms, and verifying the Ed25519 signature. This architecture ensures that mutation, drift, or tampering cannot occur without detection, maintaining the chain of custody for sensitive emotional data. All compliant systems MUST validate the proof before processing or reading the payload.
7.4 Migration and Version Anchoring
Each envelope declares explicit version identifiers for both the envelope format and the enclosed EDM schema. Version anchoring ensures interpretability across schema evolution. Schema migration follows deterministic rules: minor schema changes MUST remain backward-compatible; structural changes require major version increments; and deprecated fields MUST remain legible through defined downgrade semantics. Older artifacts must continue to be interpretable by newer readers without re-serialisation. No system is permitted to reinterpret a payload under a schema version other than the one declared in the header.
7.5 Governance Embedding
Governance descriptors are encoded in-band and constitute a structural component of the artifact's identity. These descriptors—including consent basis, jurisdictional constraints, retention windows, visibility rules, exportability conditions, and subject-rights declarations—MUST remain intact throughout the artifact's lifecycle. Governance metadata is authoritative; it MUST NOT be detached, weakened, or overridden by external policy engines or storage systems. Integrity rules apply uniformly to both governance and representational content, ensuring that subject-aligned rights persist across all system boundaries and temporal states.
7.6 Transport and Storage Guarantees
The envelope remains invariant under transport, replication, and storage. Deterministic serialisation guarantees that the artifact is encoded identically across platforms and toolchains. Payload content MUST NOT be optimised, reordered, compressed, or transformed in any manner that alters its canonical byte sequence. Governance descriptors MUST NOT be separated from the payload. Integrity guarantees MUST remain enforceable across distributed systems, archival infrastructures, and cross-jurisdictional movement, ensuring byte-identical persistence and unambiguous interpretability across the artifact's full lifecycle.
7.7 Envelope Serialisation Rules
Serialisation is governed by canonical ordering per RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), the explicit representation of null values, and stable formatting rules. The envelope MUST NOT permit optional suppression of fields, platform-dependent variation, or re-encoding of representational content. JCS ensures deterministic serialisation by defining:
- Lexicographic ordering of object keys
- Consistent number representation
- No whitespace between structural characters
- UTF-8 encoding with specific escape sequences
This deterministic serialisation ensures that any compliant system produces identical byte sequences for a given artifact, enabling cryptographic verification, long-horizon archival, and cross-vendor interoperability without reliance on proprietary decoding logic.
7.8 Stateless Envelope Configuration
The architecture supports a stateless envelope configuration for environments requiring secure transport without long-term persistence or identity binding. In this configuration, the .ddna envelope maintains integrity and provenance guarantees while enforcing the privacy constraints of the stateless modality. Specifically, within the payload of a stateless envelope, identity-binding metadata MUST be omitted, and sensitive representational domains (Milky_Way, Gravity) MUST be populated with explicit nulls. Governance descriptors are reduced to minimal structural fields required for immediate processing. This ensures that representational semantics remain unchanged and interoperable, while strictly preventing the persistence of sensitive context or identity footprints. Stateless envelopes MAY be signed by a platform authority to provide integrity guarantees without subject identity binding.
7.9 Long-Range Interpretability
The envelope is designed to remain interpretable across extended temporal horizons. This is achieved through immutable representational semantics, deterministic serialisation, cryptographic verification, explicit version anchoring, and in-band governance persistence. The envelope does not define computational behaviour; its role is to preserve representational content as a stable, governed, and verifiable object independent of the inference systems operating above it. This ensures that EDM artifacts remain intelligible across evolving model architectures, embedding geometries, and regulatory regimes.
________________________________________
8. Future Directions & Evolution Path
The Emotional Data Model (EDM) and the .ddna envelope define a representational and persistence architecture designed to remain stable across computational, regulatory, and archival environments. Evolution of the architecture MUST preserve established semantics, maintain domain geometry, and uphold all governance invariants. Future revisions MUST operate strictly within the representational boundary defined by the current schema and MUST NOT introduce inference pathways, modify existing field meaning, or alter the structural role of any domain. This section defines the representational constraints that govern forward evolution and ensure that artifacts created under v0.4.0 remain valid and structurally interpretable under later versions.
8.1 Versioning as a Structural Commitment
Version identifiers form an intrinsic part of the representational contract and determine the precise schema under which an artifact must be interpreted. Evolution of EDM MUST remain strictly backward-interpretable: artifacts produced under earlier versions MUST remain structurally legible without reconstruction, approximation, or reinterpreted logic. Any additions to the schema MUST occur only within defined extension boundaries and MUST NOT alter existing domain geometry or field semantics. Deprecation MUST NOT remove interpretability, and no revision may modify the meaning of a previously defined representational construct. This discipline ensures that representational continuity is preserved across schema generations.
8.2 Controlled Expansion of Representational Scope
Expansion of representational scope is permissible only when new structures demonstrate stable, schema-level semantics, non-interference with existing domains, and compatibility with cross-domain geometry. Initial incorporation MUST occur through crosswalk references, allowing external constructs to align with EDM fields without altering internal representational semantics. Promotion to optional schema structures is permissible only when definitional stability is established and MUST NOT introduce behavioural attributes, inferred semantics, or model-dependent constructs. Representation MUST remain independent of interpretive frameworks, and expansion MUST NOT affect the structural meaning of existing fields.
8.3 Multimodal Extension Boundaries
Future incorporation of multimodal descriptors MUST follow the same stability path applied to text-derived fields. Multimodal extensions SHOULD initially be introduced through crosswalk references or external schema extensions to validate representational utility. Promotion to normative schema substructures is permissible only when definitional stability is established, and the constructs demonstrate non-interference with existing domains. Any multimodal field MUST encode explicit, non-inferential descriptors and MUST NOT depend on temporal, behavioural, or sensory-derived interpretation. Extensions MUST preserve domain geometry, maintain schema neutrality, and operate without imposing latent or model-specific constructs.
8.4 Structural Research Trajectories
The architecture externalises affective context as a governed, schema-defined structure, establishing a stable substrate for research independent of model internals. Any analysis performed using EDM artifacts MUST remain within the representational boundary and MUST NOT depend on model activations, latent geometries, or inference mechanisms. Structural comparison, schema-conformance assessment, and representational variance studies MAY operate only on artifact-level fields as encoded. These activities do not influence schema evolution and MUST NOT modify representational semantics. EDM's evolution remains governed solely by schema discipline, version rules, and domain-geometry invariants, decoupling structural research from the volatility of inference engines.
8.5 Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability
EDM and .ddna maintain interoperability across heterogeneous computational and archival environments through deterministic serialisation, explicit version anchoring, canonical null handling, and immutable governance embedding. Interoperability arises from structural invariants rather than behavioural compatibility. Systems that store, transport, or encapsulate EDM artifacts MUST preserve envelope integrity and MUST NOT alter representational content, governance descriptors, or domain geometry. The representational contract remains authoritative across all environments in which the artifact is present, ensuring that affective context retains its structural identity regardless of the vendor or platform.
8.6 Alignment with Global Standards
EDM evolution MUST remain compatible with external standards governing structured data, provenance, archival persistence, and governance metadata. Compatibility MUST NOT modify EDM's representational semantics or domain boundaries. Serialisation rules, governance invariants, and representational geometry MUST remain canonical and independent of any external interpretive frameworks. Alignment MAY occur only at the boundary layer, through crosswalks or metadata associations that do not alter or reinterpret internal schema structures, ensuring that the protocol can co-exist with broader ecosystem standards without compromising its core definitions.
8.7 Summary
Evolution of EDM is governed by strict representational discipline. Version identifiers anchor interpretive semantics across generations; extension boundaries restrict permissible additions; multimodal constructs MUST remain explicit and non-inferential; structural analysis operates strictly on artifact-level fields; and interoperability is preserved through deterministic serialisation and in-band governance invariants. These constraints ensure that EDM artifacts remain stable, interpretable, and structurally coherent across future computational eras. Expansion is permissible only when it preserves the representational manifold and maintains the permanence of governance and domain semantics.

9. Security Architecture
The security architecture defines the structural guarantees required to preserve the integrity, sovereignty, and interpretability of EDM v0.4.0 artifacts and .ddna v1.1 envelopes across storage, transport, and multi-vendor computational environments. Because EDM externalises affective context as explicit, schema-governed representation, the security model MUST prevent mutation, reinterpretation, omission, or detachment of any representational or governance component. The architecture does not prescribe operational security frameworks, cryptographic algorithms, or platform-specific implementations; its scope is limited to the representational, structural, and validation requirements that all compliant systems MUST satisfy to ensure long-range integrity. Security in the Emotional Data Architecture Stack is achieved through deterministic serialisation, in-band governance semantics, mandatory domain completeness, immutable envelope coupling, and validation procedures that MUST precede any read, access, or computation. These guarantees ensure that EDM artifacts remain authoritative, version-anchored, and interpretable irrespective of platform behaviour, vendor infrastructure, or inference mechanisms.
9.1 Data Minimisation & Stateless Hygiene
EDM enforces strict representational boundaries to minimise data exposure. Artifacts MUST contain only the fields defined in the canonical schema; no system may introduce auxiliary identifiers, behavioural traces, embedding vectors, transport metadata, or platform-specific fields into any representational domain. Unknown or absent values MUST appear as explicit nulls in accordance with schema semantics; no omission-based signalling is permitted. To further minimise risk, systems operating in the Stateless Configuration MUST definitively nullify sensitive domains—specifically Milky_Way (Context) and Gravity (Salience)—before any persistence event, ensuring that unsealed artifacts do not retain identifiable or longitudinal data. This minimisation constraint ensures that EDM artifacts remain schema-complete, rights-aligned, and structurally consistent across heterogeneous environments.
9.2 Structural Security (In-Band Enforcement)
Security is enforced at the representational level rather than the transport level. Governance descriptors—including consent basis, retention policy, jurisdiction codes, visibility constraints, exportability rules, and subject-rights declarations—are embedded directly within the representational object and MUST remain attached to the artifact throughout its lifecycle. No system may detach, override, reinterpret, or substitute governance metadata. All systems MUST validate governance descriptors before accessing or processing the EDM payload. Because governance is encoded in-band, representational constraints are enforced independent of platform security features, ensuring consistent treatment across heterogeneous or untrusted infrastructures.
9.3 Threat Model
The architectural threat model identifies classes of violations that would compromise structural, representational, or governance integrity. These include the unauthorised modification of schema fields, removal or alteration of governance metadata, schema drift arising from non-canonical serialisation, mutation of null semantics, reordering of keys, introduction of platform-specific identifiers, and unauthorised rewriting during storage or transport. EDM mitigates these risks through canonical serialisation, explicit null preservation, domain completeness, immutable envelope binding, and version-anchored interpretive semantics. While the protocol addresses structural integrity, implementation-specific vectors—including side-channel attacks and timing attacks during cryptographic verification—remain the responsibility of the runtime environment and must be mitigated by the implementation layer. Any violation that alters structural identity MUST be detectable by integrity verification processes.
9.4 At-Rest Requirements
Artifacts stored at rest MUST retain byte-stable identity. Storage systems MUST NOT rewrite serialised content, apply transformations that alter canonical ordering, compress or reinterpret structure, or modify governance descriptors. Representational fields MUST remain exactly as emitted. Storage-layer metadata MUST remain external to the representational object and MUST NOT be introduced into EDM domains. These requirements ensure that artifacts remain structurally identical to their original emission and retain full interpretive fidelity over time.
9.5 In-Transit Requirements
Artifacts in transit MUST remain structurally and semantically identical to their stored form. Transport mechanisms MUST NOT re-serialise, re-encode, compress, or transform artifacts in ways that alter canonical field ordering, null representation, formatting, or governance metadata. Upon receipt, systems MUST validate the .ddna envelope, verify header–payload coupling, perform integrity checks, and enforce governance semantics before accessing representational content. Systems MUST NOT process an artifact prior to full validation. These requirements ensure that artifacts cannot be silently mutated or detached during transfer.
9.6 Multi-Vendor and Zero-Trust Considerations
The architecture assumes a zero-trust ecosystem in which no vendor, model family, platform, or inference system is considered authoritative. Consequently, all protection arises from representational constraints and envelope-level invariants rather than from shared trust models or platform guarantees. Canonical serialisation, explicit governance, domain completeness, version-anchored interpretive semantics, and cryptographically verifiable envelope integrity ensure that artifacts remain valid and enforceable across incompatible, decentralised, or adversarial systems.
9.7 Sovereignty Beyond Platform Boundaries
EDM artifacts retain sovereignty across all environments. Governance descriptors—including consent, jurisdiction, retention, rights, and visibility—remain embedded within the representational object and are preserved unchanged within the .ddna envelope. Platforms MUST NOT weaken, detach, or reinterpret these descriptors without violating structural validity. Identity binding is anchored through AuraID and does not rely on platform identifiers or access-control systems. Sovereignty, therefore, persists as an architectural property independent of vendor infrastructure or operational context.
9.8 Tamper Detection and Provenance Integrity
The .ddna envelope ensures provenance integrity through W3C Data Integrity Proofs. The proof block cryptographically binds both header and payload, with the `created` timestamp providing temporal anchoring. Version identifiers define the interpretive frame under which the artifact must be read. The audit chain in the header provides structural traceability without embedding behavioural logs or runtime events. Any compliant system MUST verify the proof before accessing representational content. These guarantees ensure that artifacts remain authentic, unmodified, and semantically aligned with the normative specification defined by EDM v0.4.0.
________________________________________
10. Interoperability & Crosswalks
Interoperability in EDM is defined as the capacity for external taxonomies and classification systems to reference EDM artifacts without modifying, reshaping, or influencing representational semantics. Because EDM operates as a closed, schema-governed architecture, compatibility with heterogeneous ecosystems MUST occur exclusively at the boundary layer through a strictly referential structure. The Crosswalks domain provides this boundary mechanism, enabling external systems to attach deterministic identifiers to specific EDM fields while ensuring that the artifact itself remains sovereign, byte-stable, and semantically unchanged. Interoperability thus operates outside the representational manifold and MUST NOT introduce additional semantics, behavioural assumptions, interpretive structures, or theoretical models.
10.1 Purpose and Design Philosophy
The crosswalk mechanism supports structural alignment between EDM artifacts and diverse external frameworks—ranging from established psychological taxonomies to emerging sensing modalities such as vocal prosody, facial landmarks, and empathetic inference signals. Its purpose is strictly limited to establishing machine-readable correspondence between EDM's representational fields and external categorical systems. Crosswalks MUST NOT alter, enrich, constrain, or reinterpret EDM domains; they serve solely as deterministic references for alignment. This design is governed by three architectural principles: Non-Destructive Alignment ensures that all EDM fields and structural definitions remain unchanged regardless of external referencing; Schema Preservation mandates that the EDM schema remains authoritative across all environments; and Isolation of External Semantics requires that crosswalks do not import interpretive definitions, intensity geometries, or behavioural logic. Crosswalks provide stable identifiers that reference EDM fields without participating in representational meaning.
10.2 Mandatory Structure
The Crosswalks domain is a REQUIRED top-level domain in every EDM artifact. Its structure is fully deterministic and MUST adhere to schema-defined constraints. Each crosswalk entry MUST contain a canonical identifier for the external taxonomy, a stable external label or code, the explicit EDM field or domain it references, and the version identifier for the external taxonomy. Descriptive text, commentary, or interpretive metadata is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. All entries must remain semantically inert with respect to EDM and MUST NOT affect the representational manifold. The presence of the crosswalk domain does not modify representational meaning, and its absence does not remove representational content; its function is strictly referential, ensuring structural consistency regardless of external taxonomic associations.
10.3 Non-Destructive Mapping
All crosswalk behaviour is governed by strict non-destructive guarantees. Crosswalks MAY append new reference entries, but they MUST NOT modify, redefine, or reinterpret any EDM domain or field. The representational semantics of EDM are immutable and MUST NOT be influenced by external mapping. No crosswalk entry may introduce inferred structure or conceptual meaning. The removal of the crosswalk domain MUST revert the artifact to a byte-identical form. These constraints ensure that crosswalks operate exclusively at the interoperability boundary and cannot influence representation, persistence, governance, or schema evolution.
10.4 External Taxonomy Linkage
EDM v0.4.0 supports linkage to external taxonomies through referential identifiers. This linkage is structural and non-semantic. External systems—such as categorical affect schemes, structured intensity identifiers, contextual classifications, and international metadata standards—MAY be referenced through stable codes, but their interpretive logic MUST NOT be imported into EDM. These references DO NOT introduce new representational primitives, modify existing representational semantics, or establish theoretical dependencies. Crosswalks, therefore, provide only compatibility alignment and DO NOT participate in representational geometry.
10.5 Future-Proofing and Extensibility
The interoperability architecture is designed for long-term stability across evolving taxonomic ecosystems. Each crosswalk entry MUST contain an explicit version identifier for the external taxonomy to prevent ambiguity or reinterpretation as external systems evolve. Changes in external frameworks MUST NOT trigger any modification to EDM's domains, fields, or enumerations. Crosswalk updates are isolated operations that MUST remain additive and non-invasive. New taxonomies MAY be referenced without altering any representational content. Governance descriptors, rights metadata, jurisdictional fields, and sovereignty invariants MUST remain unaffected by crosswalk behaviour. These constraints ensure that EDM artifacts maintain stable representational semantics across future analytic, regulatory, or interoperability landscapes while supporting deterministic referencing of external classification systems.
________________________________________
11. Version Evolution & Migration Discipline
Version evolution within the Emotional Data Architecture Stack is governed by strict representational discipline. Because EDM encodes affective context as an explicit, schema-bound object rather than a model-internal construct, any change to the schema must preserve the interpretive integrity of all existing artifacts. Versioning operates as an architectural mechanism rather than an implementation detail; it defines how representational semantics remain stable across revisions, how new fields may be introduced without disturbing prior meaning, and how systems interpret artifacts over extended temporal horizons. The .ddna envelope reinforces these guarantees by binding the schema version identifier within the header, ensuring that decoding requirements remain deterministic across all environments. Schema evolution is intentionally conservative; while versions may extend representational capacity or refine constraints, they MUST NOT reinterpret or repurpose existing fields. The primary goal of the versioning architecture is to guarantee that artifacts created under earlier schema versions remain legible and semantically stable across future environments, vendors, and computational ecosystems.
11.1 Version Lineage (v0.1 → v0.2 → v0.3 → v0.4.0 → v0.4.1)
The EDM version lineage reflects the incremental expansion of representational structure while maintaining all prior semantics. v0.1 introduced the initial domain layout and core governance constructs. v0.2 stabilised domain boundaries, normalised narrative primitives, and formalised governance invariants. v0.3 introduced the crosswalk architecture, refined governance fields, and established alignment with the .ddna envelope layer. v0.4.0 solidified these definitions into a normative standard. v0.4.1 updates the envelope cryptographic model to W3C Data Integrity Proofs while preserving all EDM representational semantics. Across all versions, no existing field has had its meaning modified, and no representational semantics have been reinterpreted. Version identifiers embedded in the EDM artifact and in the .ddna header allow systems to determine decoding requirements deterministically.
11.2 Migration Principles
Migration between schema versions is strictly structural and MUST NOT introduce new interpretation. The architecture mandates that migration be deterministic, ensuring that a migration process always produces the same output for a given artifact regardless of vendor or implementation. Migration MUST NOT reinterpret existing values; fields encoded under earlier schemas retain their original semantics and may not be transformed to simulate newer constructs. New structures MUST be additive; when lifting to a higher version, new fields introduced by the updated schema must default to null or their canonical initial values. Crucially, governance metadata MUST remain unchanged; all governance fields must remain intact, unmodified, and authoritative across version transitions. The architecture STRICTLY PROHIBITS the compression, merging, collapsing, or reinterpretation of representational elements during migration.
11.3 Backwards Compatibility
Backwards compatibility ensures that systems built for earlier schema versions can process artifacts created under newer versions. This is achieved by anchoring all representational semantics to earlier interpretations and by ensuring that new fields do not modify or extend the meaning of pre-existing structures. When older systems encounter unknown fields, they MUST be able to omit them without loss of meaning or ambiguity. Backwards compatibility requires explicit null fallback rules, stable semantics for all earlier fields, and deterministic downgrade profiles encoded at the envelope layer. The architecture prohibits the introduction of any field whose presence requires reinterpretation by older systems.
11.4 Lifting and Downgrading Rules
Version transitions follow two controlled, purely structural pathways: lifting (upgrade) and downgrading. Lifting requires preserving all existing content unchanged while populating new version-specific fields with null or their canonical initial values. The version identifier MUST be updated in both the artifact and the .ddna header, but no semantic transformation is permitted. Downgrading requires removing fields that do not exist in the target version while strictly preserving the semantics and byte-level content of fields that remain valid. Systems MUST NOT collapse, merge, compress, or reinterpret newer structures during a downgrade. Governance invariants MUST remain stable across both lifting and downgrading operations. These processes maintain representational invariants and ensure that artifacts remain authoritative and interpretable within their target schema version.
11.5 Deprecated Structures
Deprecation is treated as a semantic freeze. When a field or domain is deprecated, its semantics become fixed, immutable, and frozen; it MUST NOT be repurposed, modified, or reassigned to new meaning in any future version. Its presence in existing artifacts MUST remain interpretable, and documentation MUST record its deprecated status and intended phasing rules. Deprecation DOES NOT mandate removal; existing artifacts retain their deprecated fields unchanged, and only future schema versions may omit them once safe downgrade paths exist. This discipline preserves long-range interpretability for artifacts produced under older schemas.
11.6 Forward Compatibility and Future Schema Extensions
Forward compatibility ensures that artifacts created under earlier schema versions remain valid and interpretable under future versions. This requires that schema evolution follows three architectural constraints. First, Representational Invariants must remain intact; new fields and domains MUST NOT alter the representational semantics of existing structures. Second, Extensions must be predictable and non-breaking; new structures MUST appear only at defined extension points and MUST NOT disrupt domain boundaries. Third, Crosswalks must remain isolated; external taxonomy updates MUST NOT influence representational semantics or schema evolution. Finally, Envelope-Bound Versioning must remain authoritative, with the .ddna header providing the grounding for interpreting artifacts across version transitions. Through these constraints, the architecture ensures that EDM can evolve over time while remaining a stable, interoperable substrate for affective representation across computational eras.

12. Conclusion: EDM as the Representational Bedrock
EDM v0.4.0 defines affective context as a structured, governed, and portable data object. It establishes the representational conditions under which emotional state can exist independently of any model, vendor, or computational environment, and remain interpretable across systems and time. By externalising affective state into a schema-defined manifold and binding it to a deterministic persistence envelope, the architecture provides a stable substrate where emotional information can be preserved rather than inferred, inspected rather than guessed, and transported rather than recreated.
The protocol's structural invariants—schema completeness, deterministic serialisation, and in-band governance—ensure that emotional context is durable, sovereign, and resistant to interpretive drift. EDM does not define how systems should use this information; it defines how it must be represented so that any future computation, reasoning, or alignment approach can rely on a consistent and governed foundation.
EDM stands alone in this role. It does not predict or prescribe the architectures built on top of it; it simply establishes the representational foundation those systems will require.
Explicit emotional state precedes representation; representation precedes computation.

Appendix C — The .ddna Envelope Format (v1.1)
The .ddna envelope is the cryptographically anchored, governance-preserving container that binds an EDM artifact into a durable, portable, and sovereign emotional memory unit. Version 1.1 adopts W3C Data Integrity Proofs for cryptographic binding.

C.1 Minimum Normative Envelope Structure
Below is the minimal valid structure for a compliant .ddna v1.1 envelope containing an EDM v0.4.0 artifact.
{
  "ddna_header": {
    "ddna_version": "1.1",
    "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "edm_version": "0.4.0",

      "ttl_days": null,
      "on_expiry": "soft_delete"
    },
    "consent_basis": "explicit_consent",

      }
    ]
  },

      "version": "0.4.0",
      "..." : "..."
    },
    "core": { "...": "..." },
    "constellation": { "...": "..." },
    "milky_way": { "...": "..." },
    "gravity": { "...": "..." },
    "impulse": { "...": "..." },
    "governance": { "...": "..." },
    "telemetry": { "...": "..." },
    "system": { "...": "..." },
    "crosswalks": { "...": "..." }
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
    "cryptosuite": "eddsa-jcs-2022",
    "created": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkiTBz1ymuepAQ4HEHYSF1H8quG5GLVVQR3djdX3mDooWp",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "proofValue": "z3FXQeKviyRpKzPHgXtUfB3GRdJHWbvEAiDMYPJ7vLxQCdDmtJUnXfJNS4R8kPJF5w..."
  }
}

C.2 Header Fields
The `ddna_header` contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ddna_version` | string | Envelope format version. MUST be "1.1" for this specification. |
| `created_at` | string | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of envelope creation. |
| `edm_version` | string | EDM schema version (e.g., "0.4.0"). |
| `owner_user_id` | string \| null | AuraID or vendor-specific subject identifier. Null for stateless. |
| `exportability` | string | One of: `allowed`, `restricted`, `prohibited`. |
| `jurisdiction` | string | Regulatory jurisdiction code (e.g., "AU", "GDPR", "CCPA"). |
| `retention_policy` | object | Contains `basis`, `ttl_days`, `on_expiry`. |
| `consent_basis` | string | Legal basis for processing. |
| `masking_rules` | array | Redaction requirements for display or export. |
| `payload_type` | string | Type identifier for the payload (e.g., "edm.v0.4.0"). |
| `audit_chain` | array | Lifecycle events. Each entry has `at`, `event`, `agent`. |

Note: The `encryption` and `compression` fields present in v1.0 have been removed. These concerns are delegated to transport and storage layers.

C.3 Proof Block (W3C Data Integrity)
The `proof` block follows the W3C Data Integrity specification using the `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | MUST be "DataIntegrityProof". |
| `cryptosuite` | string | MUST be "eddsa-jcs-2022". |
| `created` | string | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp when the proof was created. |
| `verificationMethod` | string | DID URL identifying the signing key. |
| `proofPurpose` | string | MUST be "assertionMethod". |
| `proofValue` | string | Multibase base58-btc encoded signature (prefix `z`). |
| `expires` | string | Optional. ISO-8601 timestamp after which proof is invalid. |
| `domain` | string | Optional. Domain binding for proof scope. |
| `challenge` | string | Optional. Challenge value for proof freshness. |
| `nonce` | string | Optional. Nonce for replay protection. |

C.4 Signing Input Construction
The signing input is computed per the W3C Data Integrity specification:

1. Create `proof_options`: The proof block without `proofValue`
2. Create `document`: `{ "ddna_header": ..., "edm_payload": ... }`
3. Canonicalize both using RFC 8785 JCS
4. Compute: `signing_input = SHA-256(JCS(proof_options)) || SHA-256(JCS(document))`
5. Sign with Ed25519: `signature = Ed25519.sign(signing_input, private_key)`
6. Encode: `proofValue = multibase_base58btc(signature)`

C.5 Verification Methods
The `verificationMethod` field contains a DID URL that resolves to the signing public key:

- `did:key:z6Mk...` — Self-contained Ed25519 public key (recommended for portability)
- `did:web:example.com#key-1` — Web-resolvable DID document
- `did:auraid:...` — Future AuraID-native DID method

C.6 Audit Chain
The `audit_chain` array records lifecycle events. Each entry contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `at` | string | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the event. |
| `event` | string | Event type: `created`, `transferred`, `verified`, `expired`. |
| `agent` | string | Identifier of the system or actor that performed the event. |

Audit chain entries are append-only. The chain is signed as part of the header, so modifications after sealing are detectable. Systems MAY append entries to the audit chain after sealing for tracking purposes, but such additions invalidate the original proof and require re-sealing.

C.7 Migration from v1.0
Envelopes created under v1.0 with `ddna_integrity` blocks remain valid and interpretable. To migrate:

1. Remove `ddna_integrity` block
2. Remove `encryption` and `compression` fields from header (if present)
3. Add `audit_chain` to header (migrate from `ddna_integrity.audit_chain` if present)
4. Update `ddna_version` to "1.1"
5. Create and attach W3C Data Integrity `proof` block
6. Re-seal with appropriate signing key

Appendix D — Validation Summary
Protocol-level requirements for representational and persistence validity.
Validation ensures that EDM artifacts maintain structural integrity, interpretive stability, and governance continuity across systems, vendors, and temporal horizons. It is the mechanism through which the representational and persistence layers enforce the guarantees defined in the core architecture. Validation is not an implementation detail; it is a protocol obligation that constrains how artifacts may be created, transported, interpreted, and sealed.
Validation applies independently to the representational layer (EDM schema) and the persistence layer (.ddna envelope). An artifact is valid only when all representational requirements are satisfied and all persistence constraints, when applicable, are met. Invalid artifacts MUST NOT be admitted into any computational workflow. Invalid artifacts MUST NOT be encapsulated within a .ddna envelope. All interpretive and computational behaviour is downstream of validation.
D.1 Representational Validity
An EDM artifact is representationally valid when its structure and content conform to all mandatory schema constraints. These requirements ensure that every artifact produced under the specification remains fully interpretable, non-inferential, and domain-complete.
Representational validity requires the following conditions:
1. Domain Presence
All ten top-level representational domains MUST be present. Absence is not permitted. Fields may contain explicit null values but MUST NOT be omitted.
2. Schema Alignment
All fields defined by the canonical schema MUST be initialised and MUST conform to their declared type, permitted value sets, and canonical enumerations. Temporal fields MUST use ISO-8601 UTC format. Categorical values MUST use canonical token forms. Embedding references MUST be indirections; no inline vectors are permitted.
3. Non-Inferential Semantics
All populated values MUST originate from explicit narrative content, observable structure, user-declared metadata, or deterministic extraction logic. Latent activations, psychological constructs, behavioural predictions, or unverifiable model-internal states MUST NOT enter the representational payload.
4. Governance Completeness
When identity-bearing or persistence-relevant fields are present, the governance domain MUST be complete, internally consistent, and unambiguous. Consent, jurisdiction, retention, visibility, exportability, and rights descriptors MUST be fully specified.
5. Deterministic Serialisation
The artifact MUST serialise deterministically. No extraneous fields, unbounded structures, or order-dependent ambiguities are permitted. Byte-stable identity MUST be possible from the serialised form.
An artifact failing any representational requirement is invalid.
D.2 Persistence Validity (.ddna Envelope)
A .ddna envelope is valid only when its structural, cryptographic, and governance requirements are satisfied. Persistence validity is distinct from representational validity: an artifact may be representationally valid but ineligible for sealing if persistence constraints are not met.
Persistence validity requires the following conditions:
1. Envelope Structure
The envelope MUST contain a header (`ddna_header`), proof block (`proof`), and payload (`edm_payload`) in the arrangement defined by this specification. Required fields MUST be present and correctly initialised.
2. Integrity Guarantees
The envelope MUST contain a valid W3C Data Integrity proof. The proof MUST verify against the canonical form of the header and payload using the specified verification method. The `cryptosuite` MUST be `eddsa-jcs-2022`. The `proofPurpose` MUST be `assertionMethod`.
3. Payload Conformity
The EDM artifact referenced by the envelope MUST be representationally valid, MUST appear exactly as signed, and MUST NOT differ in any respect from the payload covered by the proof.
4. Governance Enforcement
Envelope creation MUST reflect and enforce all governance constraints of the payload. Exportability, retention, jurisdiction, consent, and masking declarations MUST be honoured at sealing. If exportability prohibits persistence, sealing is prohibited.
5. Byte-Stable Sealing
A sealed envelope MUST maintain byte-stable identity across storage and transport. Any modification of header, proof block, or payload invalidates the envelope.
An envelope failing any persistence requirement is invalid.

D.2.1 Verification Order Requirements
Systems processing .ddna envelopes MUST follow this verification sequence:

1. **Load**: Read envelope from storage or transport
2. **Parse**: Deserialise JSON structure
3. **Structural Check**: Verify presence of `ddna_header`, `edm_payload`, `proof`
4. **Proof Verification**: Verify cryptographic proof BEFORE accessing payload content
   - Resolve `verificationMethod` to obtain public key
   - Reconstruct signing input from canonical forms
   - Verify Ed25519 signature
5. **Governance Check**: Evaluate `exportability`, `visibility`, retention status
6. **Content Access**: Only after all checks pass, expose payload to consumer

Systems MUST NOT expose envelope content before completing proof verification. This ordering prevents processing of tampered or forged envelopes.

D.2.2 MIME Type Handling
Systems handling .ddna files MUST recognise the following MIME types:

| MIME Type | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `application/json` | Unsealed EDM artifacts (`.edm.json`) |
| `application/vnd.deepadata.ddna+json` | Sealed .ddna envelopes (`.ddna`) |

When serving or receiving .ddna files over HTTP or other protocols, the `application/vnd.deepadata.ddna+json` MIME type signals that the content is a governed envelope requiring signature verification.

D.3 Validator Responsibilities
A conformant validator MUST enforce all representational and persistence requirements defined above. Validators operate at the protocol boundary and determine whether an artifact may participate in representational, persistence, or computational workflows.
Validator responsibilities include:
1. Pre-Admission Enforcement
No artifact may be admitted into any computational workflow until representational validity is confirmed.
2. Pre-Sealing Enforcement
No artifact may enter the .ddna sealing workflow unless both representational and persistence validity conditions are satisfied.
3. Non-Modification Requirement
Validators MUST NOT modify, infer, reconstruct, or reinterpret representational content. The only permissible normalisation is deterministic structural normalisation that does not alter schema semantics, value meaning, or governance declarations.
4. Failure Handling
Artifacts or envelopes failing any requirement are invalid and MUST NOT be processed, persisted, or transported.
5. Interpretive Isolation
Validation outcomes MUST NOT alter or introduce representational semantics. Validation determines admissibility, not interpretive meaning.
D.4 Stateless Operation
Stateless operation corresponds to the architectural path in which a fully formed EDM artifact is used exclusively within an immediate computational session and is not committed to sovereign persistence. The extraction engine produces a complete, schema-valid EDM artifact. The commit decision determines whether that artifact enters the .ddna sealing workflow (Path B) or remains confined to stateless coherence (Path A).
A stateless artifact is a complete EDM representation derived from the non-commit outcome of this decision. Stateless artifacts remain fully subject to all representational validity requirements defined in D.1. Statelessness does not alter domain composition; it constrains the semantics of selected domains to ensure that no identity-bearing or persistence-relevant information is available beyond the active session.
The following invariants define stateless operation:
Identity Neutrality
Fields that bind the artifact to a persistent, real-world, or account-level identity MUST NOT contain identifying values in the retained stateless representation. Structural positions remain unchanged, but identity resolution is prohibited.
Context Neutrality
The milky_way domain MUST remain structurally present to satisfy domain completeness. However, in a stateless artifact all fields within the milky_way domain MUST be set to null. No location, event, environmental, or third-party contextual detail of any kind may be retained.
This guarantees that the stateless representation carries zero persistent or re-identifiable context while preserving the structural position of the domain.
Salience Neutrality
The gravity domain MUST remain structurally present to satisfy domain completeness. However, in a stateless artifact all fields within the gravity domain MUST be set to null. No recurrence, tether, durability, weight, or any other salience-related property may be encoded or retained.
This ensures that the stateless representation carries no persistence, prioritisation, or longitudinal salience semantics of any form.
Governance Neutrality
The governance domain MUST indicate non-persistence. Retention, exportability, and sovereignty semantics MUST NOT permit archival storage, inheritance, or cross-system portability. Stateless artifacts cannot become sovereign emotional memory objects.
Telemetry and System Neutrality
The telemetry and system domains MUST NOT contain identifiers, statistics, or linkage structures implying continuity across sessions. No retrieval-history or long-horizon usage signals MAY be encoded.
Persistence Prohibition
Stateless artifacts are ineligible for sealing. .ddna envelopes MUST NOT be created from stateless artifacts. No persistence semantics apply.
Stateless operation preserves full representational fidelity during the session while ensuring that artifacts not committed to sovereign persistence cannot function as rights-bearing or persistently identifiable emotional records.
D.5 Summary
Validation enforces the structural, semantic, and governance guarantees upon which EDM interoperability depends. Representational validity ensures that the artifact conforms to the schema and contains only explicit, auditable, non-inferential content. Persistence validity ensures that the envelope maintains integrity, sovereignty, and transport safety. Stateless operation restricts persistence, not representation. Validators act as architectural gatekeepers, ensuring that only conformant artifacts participate in representational, persistence, and computational workflows.
This appendix defines the minimal normative validation contract for EDM v0.4.0. Extended validator profiles, reference implementations, and operational guidelines MAY be maintained in separate companion documentation.

D.6 Reference Implementation
The `deepadata-ddna-tools` package provides a reference implementation of the sealing and verification procedures described in this specification. Test vectors and canonical examples are maintained in the tool repository.

Appendix E — Glossary of Protocol Terms
This glossary defines all terms used in the EDM v0.4.0 representational schema, the .ddna persistence layer, and the Emotional Data Architecture Stack. All definitions are sourced directly from the specification and are free of behavioural or inferential semantics.
A

Affective Manifold The complete representational geometry formed by the ten mandatory EDM domains. Defines the coordinate space for narrative, contextual, emotional, salience, and motivational signals.
Anchor A Core primitive identifying the central person, idea, object, or symbolic focus of an experience.
AuraID A neutral, optional identity-binding mechanism that preserves strict separation between identity metadata and affective representation.
B
Bridge A Core primitive describing the cognitive or emotional shift that allows reframing, integration, or reconciliation within the narrative.
Byte-Stable A property of serialized artifacts requiring that the payload remains bit-for-bit identical across storage systems, enabling deterministic hashing and long-term interpretability.
C
Canonical Enumerations Normative sets of permitted values defined by the EDM schema. Vendors MUST NOT modify or extend these sets without versioning.
Compute Boundary The architectural line separating the representational and persistence layers (EDM and .ddna) from all downstream computation.
Constellation The EDM domain encoding emotional topology, including primary emotion, subtones, archetype, higher-order emotion, meta-emotional state, insight, and related descriptors.

Crosswalks A referential mapping to external taxonomies (e.g., Plutchik, ISO) that does not alter EDM semantics.
D
.ddna Envelope The sovereign, cryptographically anchored persistence container that encapsulates an EDM payload with governance rules, version anchoring, and integrity guarantees.
